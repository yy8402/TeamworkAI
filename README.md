# TeamworkAI

Supervise AI/LLM to generate a team of AI agents, define the workflow, and get the job done.

I got the idea after watching Andrew NG's [Agentic Reasoning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sal78ACtGTc), and made the conceptual demo with CLI work.   

# TODO
1. GUI & web service;
2. support multimodal tasks
3. support more llms, e.g. Gemeni, Claude, LLaMA
4. allow different personas to use different model 
5. compatible with [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI), which has been doing a great job to get predefined AI crews working on predefined tasks.
6. flowchart for workflow
